# File: T1 vs KT Rolster  LCK 2024 Summer Playoffs - Round 1 Match 2  Unofficial Live Discussion_comments.txt
----------------------------------------
I feel like that Guma mistake is the kind that can haunt some players for their entire career, it haunted him for like 2 minutes.
[removed]
my apple watch gave me a heart rate notification this team will kill me one day
[removed]
T1 giving me heart attacks
Props to Oner for the dragon steal, man. That teamfight is lost if KT got the soul
GUMA SAID WATCH MY SHUFFLE

  
and then 1 min later 

GUMA SAID WATCH MY SHUFFLE AGAIN
Welcome home Zeus my goat! And GumaGod and KeriaGod and OnerGod, Faker you're still cool.
Guma said hang on I got it this time
fuck this team
Guma fucks up, 5 mins later: Oh wait I know I'm just better
the KT experience, summarized in a single game
When in doubt, gank faker via 3 vs 1 avengers strat.

KT vs T1 always delivers.
T1: BACK BACK BACK BACK!

GUMA: GO GO GO GO!
Who needs a Rell when you got Guma's Nilah???
Haha wth was that lose both barons just get a penta kill and then almost get another and you can still win
I went to pee right after the second baron, only to come back with T1 rushing our nexus lmaoooooo  
Why did i think we would be a normal team ffs
T1 finally have an excuse to play Senna again, atleast they finally took it off of Guma.
NAHHH M8 TEAMFIGHT 1 IS BACK 
please let this be one of faker’s weird game one and that he locks in for the next game
After that fight mid, I thought KT had this in the bag.

And that's exactly when I knew T1 would go 1-0.
Oner is the only one that trusts Guma lol. Thank goodness for that bc those two are keeping T1 floating. Zeus and Keria look relatively back on form as well. Without Faker getting back to form, I don’t think this team can win LCK or Worlds, but they can make deep runs with the other 4.
Guma 
got guma off senna, now on rell duty
“Do you think, when you get into a game like this, you just mute top?” 

Fucking savage casting

Followed up by “ruthless predator? More like toothless predator”.

Zeus might not have got perfect yet, but the casters are in a kill streak

“I would message riot afterwards and ask them to delete Renekton from my account”

STOP, STOP, HE’S ALREADY DEAD
Guma the future of T1!
Well now we at least have Beryl and Deft set up for clutching it in the gauntlet for Worlds qualification, so the perfect script is still intact.
GUMA BEACON OF LIGHT, THE REDEEMER
Zeus AKA big dick bee
Ffs, WHY DID KT stick around after it was stolen, JUST LEAVE
What a disgusting Senna , One Q and heals half health of atleast two , Ults and full HP all allies

T1 did their homework pretty well , but this Senna is unplayable. Hopefully we dont see her in drafts anymore
Least stressful Telecom War.
It is Guma. He is the GOAT in his mind.
That's what they said after DRX vs EDG game 2 when the inhib respawned
I’d feel bad for them but this is the fourth game in a row they blinded Renekton. It’s an impossible, miserable matchup but they opted into it.
FUCK MY LIFE
I think rework Senna with a Nilah+Olaf might be a bit too much to handle. 

Kudos to Deft and Beryl though, I think both of their builds were pretty smart (really liked the Serpent Fang + Shurelya pickups to deny some of what T1's comp can do), but ultimately this T1 comp is just too broken to afford any mistakes against it.
I hate this team. And I hate myself for loving this team.
Oner always does that vs everyone not named Canyon.
Exactly what was needed.
Tbf, if this is SoloQ and your Jungler ignores you like this, you are legally allowed to just afk/straight up run it vs Vayne. This matchup is disgustingly one sided without jungle attention.
Not playing good =/= not a good player bro…
To go bankrupt? You’re proposing removing the primary revenue generator that allows them to be completely self sufficient? Everytime people suggest this I just wonder if they know the bare minimum when it comes to money and business.
T1 and KT saw how much of a banger lcs was earlier so they decided to make up for DK FOX yesterday
[deleted]
GUMA GOD
free my man Guma from Senna duty
Perfect with the 5.6 cspm
Zeus OLAF PENTA boy!!
Really wish we had a thread to talk about these games lol
Cocky draft from T1 mannnn
T1 Vs. KT series always delivers with rollercoasters worth of games!
I shouted KT are doing it at two different points during this game so its my fault really
Guma must've done something to be treated like this. He has a game-winning team fight on Nilah in game 1, then put on AP support Senna duty in game 2.
maybe time to purchase some eyes, cuz there was a lillia sleep on bdd
SCORSESE, NOLAN, KUROSAWA, TELECOM WARS
Lore-accurate Telecom Wars
Lmao why is KT with the long range comp flashing in vs the "fuck it we ball" dive in comp
You deserved to get bullied by Top Vayne if you pick Renekton four times in a row
God I hate Renekton in "lets abandon top" comps, the champ's useless
Whoever gets T1 next series is going to permaban Azir and make Faker useless tbh
At this point the fact that KT prioritized Renekton so hard Im convinced Perfect is not comfortable on any other champ (not like he looks comfortable on Renekton either...)
The KT no engage comp vs Smolder is looking pretty good
It’s handy if you make a mistake to have a turbocharged crackrabbit viking piloted by Zeus to wallpaper over the issue
and kt loses, of fucking course lmao.
Yes. The laser is out of playoffs but there is still a regional qualifier for worlds. They will be there to compete for last spot at worlds from lck
Criticising people that deserve criticism at the time is wrong huh?
PPPPPPEEEEEEENNNNTTTAAAAAAA
DEATH TAXES AND THE TELECOM WAR
guma def carried harder than zeus
Average 600 MS Olaf
I left and KT was winning, came back and KT lost. I'm sorry.
Ocean drake with a Senna my god
T1 draft 0 engage vs scaling carries. The results will shock you.
Lets make a ranged champion with %burn, infinite scaling, mobility over walls, what could possibly go wrong
Yea, Renekton still not doing anything.

  
Not even the main reason for the loss but idk why it keeps getting picked.
C'mon man, How does that get stolen.... Lol
KT played like ass but how the hell did Senna go through draft but they ban Kennen immediately after banning Nasus??? What.
Hey, that game 1 with Guma on a carry was great...

Let's put him on Senna for Game 2.....
LEGO KT
BRO WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS DRAFT
T1 cooking something again... Sej with Lux + 3 ADCs lmao. But at least we got Guma/Keria's Cait/Lux bot lane.
Gotta start putting Faker on enchanters and tanks mid I think.
GUMA SENNA IS BACK ON THE MENU BOYS
Faker for Tier 2 and Drake
Lol?? They were running as much as possible, T1 just managed the chase down perfectly. You could argue if they split to two directions, they maybe save 1 more person, but they were never getting out there with every1.
Faker has been playing a lot of Nasus so I can only assume he’s been doing well on it in scrims, and I guess they’re scared of AD Kennen???
KT bros it was this guy 
Yeah he almost tossed game 1 as well when KT got the baron on his missed shuffle - definitely concerning
Wait until he picks TF and Kennen
Buff after buff after buff eventually pushes a stat-check like him into pro. Base dmg on E is absolutely disgusting early, and no champ really can handle it outside of maybe artillery mages who simply out-range him.

 Also pretty decent into comps that stack a lot of ADC-s.
Nah he's just the scapegoat on KT really
Nasus is being picked because of all the adcs… nerf them and he leaves
They stuck around for 4-5 seconds.
They literally stayed for an extra 4-5 seconds after the steal posturing for a fight. Rewatch it.
STOP GIVING GUMA SENNA
Deft sacrificing himself there to kill the enemy team was amazing holy
I got up after Guma's first engage in midlane then I came back to them winning. Most normal telecom war experience. 
POG? Back to Senna duty
LMAO FIESTA TIME

# File: Dplus KIA vs. BNK FearX  LCK 2024 Summer Playoffs - Round 1  Post-Match Discussion_comments.txt
----------------------------------------
FOX weren't convinced Moham's Rell was a problem, so DK had to teach them a lesson with that last team comp
*This has to be one of the single most solvable draft series in LCK recent history.* 

Why Rell kept making it through, only god knows. One would think after the ***Seventh Game Winning Magnet Storm*** you would use the goddamn Nasus joke bans on it or something, just to try and force another pick, especially after a Game 3 win that lived on Rell early versus Ziggs late to that comical degree. But no, we're here, banning the thing that's losing you the games is apparently for plebs.

Moham is the MVP of the series but never has a man been gifted the win on a silver platter this shiny. What the fuck even was that.
They gave Moham Rell four times. 

FOX gave Moham Rell four times in a row.
Yeah moham buddy u're not seeing rell ever again
They really let the rell one trick play rell 4 games lmao
Way too many LCK coaches are just dogshit stubborn about banning things that they can't beat. It's a repeat of last season where Delight kept getting Rakan every game and hard carrying.
B_N R_LL

I would report DK's opponents for trolling if Moham ever gets Rell again for the rest of playoffs.

Ryu, BNK, honey, you don't have to play the game on hard mode.
[deleted]
No way they're gonna pick rell a 4th time in a row right?
It's heartwarming to see BNK adopting the LCK long and proud tradition of not banning champions who are giving them plenty of problems.
I don’t know.  I would have thought that after game 1 or 2 or 3, but hey game 4 came and went with Rell
Let‘s not forget Daeny not banning the most broken champ in the history of league at worlds quarterfinals and losing.
Kingen Aatrox Aware
Score giving over J4 to Xun FIVE FUCKING GAMES IN A ROW is absolutely insane. The even worse example was worlds 2021 where JieJie got to play J4 7 games in a row, starting from EDG vs RNG game 5 to EDG vs DK game 1. Inbetween that, JieJie got to play J4 5 games in a row in the semifinals, ALSO vs GEN. What the fuck were they thinking
Absolutely deserved for not banning Rell.
BNK really said wow let’s give Moham Rell for the 4th time. We just barely won game 3 with a crazy late game ziggs stall that we couldn’t win faster because of this guy’s Rell but let’s try again for the 4th time maybe it will work out? It did not
cvMax would have figured out a way to give DK two Rells just to prove a point.
Nah, Alistar will neutralize it next game, trust.
Like it's even more egregious in the final set cause you saw us pick MF

Fucking ban or take the rell lmao
Bun Roll? Yum
I guess Moham is just the best Rell in the world
Mohamed is clean with it
FearX coach: Hmm, let's just give Moham his Rell once again <- Clueless
no difference whether it was BNK or KDF that made it because my brother cvMax would have left Rell open as well
I feel like FOX completely inted every teamfight against Rell every game.
Sure but that was legitimately the best Rell performance in a series I’ve seen in a LONG time
Might be a hot take but I think that was one of the rare occasions where the better team lost the series. Fuck Yuumi
imagine giving Moham Rell every single game
Dk immediately ban the ziggs after losing to it and then theres BNK
Or GenG vs EDG 2021 semis where Jiejie got J4 5 games in a row
How I imagine this series went:

Coach, can we ban Rell?

-________________________-

Whoever's in charge of Moham's career montage had to have paid off FearX.
Tbh we really should have won that first game but canyon over extended with that dive lol 

That would have made geng think twice about picking yuumi
Kellin begging DK's future opponents to ban Rell so he keeps his job
GUYS LET'S LET RELL THROUGH FOR THE 4TH IT'LL SURELY WORK THIS TIME GUYS TRUST ME AAAAAAAAAA 

Fire this coach jesus CHRIST Moham you are INSANE Labrov of LCK
DK vs GENG 2022 and GENG had Yuumi
Who the f is Ben Rell.
Or Crown's Malzahar in the world finals.
100%, the ego is _wild_.

You'd rather your team lose than have to admit your opponent is good at a champ/you suck at playing against it? Really?
Or GenG vs BLG 2023 quarterfinals where Xun got J4 5 games in a row also
This Moham fella is kinda good at Rell
fire coach into the sun bad.
Did game 1 nasus traumatized them? There's no way nasus kept getting a ban slot in the series. 
It's a mix of that and Duro's Alistar as a projected hard counter, that in their eyes left (wrongly) a ban open to burn on Nasus

The... I won't say problem, because he played well, but "quirk" here is that **Duro was playing for hardcore engage every single fight**, despite being on an Ali drafted for peel and counter-engage.

Time and time again across the series FearX would start a fight with advantage, then Duro would use W, and they'd immediately get Magnet Stormed. It goes without saying but Rell does not get to R at melee range, barring flash-W, if Alistar has W up.

Aside from the catches started by Ali W-Q, there's barely any reason to use Headbutt if you're winning the fight and haven't seen the Rell ult go off. That's your Lose Condition, especially when the enemy team is starting to draft full AoE assuming you'll let them Magnet Storm you every fight, ***because that's what you've been doing.***

Duro's engages got FearX a few picks, and it's almost unarguably what locked the Game 3 winning teamfight, but if your entire draft strategy against Rell is to not let her play, you should not be burning the resources you need for that every other second. 

This is the LCK Playoffs, Moham knows what the Headbutt animation looks like lmao

All in all it was a strange series. Nasus did well, but its success was very much a teamwide thing (and a rell thing eks dee) in game 1, and probably did not warrant a ban unless FearX was planning on drafting full attack speed comps every game. 

And like, they played Ziggs in game 3, clearly they had options.
Crown malzahar aware.
Rell is the litmus test for Pro support players, it’s so easy to look good on that champ

If you don’t look good on Rell you are just dogshit. See Targamas
Yeah, Beryl's Alistar will definitely neutralize Keria's Rell.
wtf two rells
DK is such a scuffed team because they can go from the absolute slop that was game 3 to just smashing your skull into the concrete in the blink of an eye.
Honestly I‘m not convinced with Moham‘s Rell yet. I think we should let it through couple more series’s.
I mean DK was popping off that tournament regardless of their regular season results. Especially Showmaker. But Ruler was the best adc of the year during the time ADC‘s were the only important role. Yuumi definitely puts a shade on GENG‘s win but I‘m not sure who was the better team.
[Ryu: Mmm.... Bun Roll](https://gifdb.com/images/high/homer-drooling-gif-file-2175kb-g10yaf1syf0xjp9s.gif)
Honestly I‘m not convinced with Moham‘s Rell yet. I think we should let it through couple more series’s.
I think that’s been said many times, it was Faker who thought he could handle it not the coaches letting it through.
I mean... I would say FOX gave Moham the performance of a lifetime. Moham found the angles but man why Fox decided to be in ult range every single time is beyond me. 

Half of Mohams Ults was IN VISION. LITERALLY SPOTTED THE RELL BEFORE HE ULTED IN. AND THEY STILL GOT CAUGHT.
If Rell scuffs her engage she will at least usually die for it and look like an inter, if Rakan Ws empty air no prob he can just double E back to a teammate to bail his ass out and look less stupid.


Rakan is THE ultimate fraud support champ
Moham just ended Kellin's career for good.
Aside from the obvious Rell stuff, I honestly don't know how you mentally recover from a series like that as Hena. That 1v1 at the start of the last game was just the cherry on top of a very depressing performance where he only did decently when he wasn't playing ADC.
Reminds me of geng giving away jarvan five times to blg
I would say Rakan over Rell. there’s so many frauds that got away by one tricking Rakan, ie. biofrost, baolan..
In Canyon's defense, DK simply had bad teams the last years he was there. You saw how great he was when Nuguri was still playing for Damwon and also now on this stacked GenG roster he shines again.
Even the post match team knows this was a 4-0 lmfao
I don't have a single fucking nice thing to say after that game 4 draft.
FOX have one job : Ban Rell

And They never did it

And They always run to Rell ult

FOR ALL GAMES, AND THEY NEVER LEARN

They deserves to lose
FOX probably thought they would galaxy brain reverse psychology DK by not banning out Rell in game 4 because they have some secret counter to them, but DK was like, "nah, we'll just pick Rell and win"
holy FUCK HOW DOES HE KEEP FINDING THESE ANGLES

his W on clozer's TP was so fucking sexy I thought he fucked up the timing but there was 0 chance for a reaction
Maybe B_N R_LL?
Nah, just a one win. No way he does it again...


-next eliminated team
Bun Roll? Sounds delicious.
Depends on how good Moham is with enchanters
Another team after losing to Moham‘s Rell: „Honestly we thought we could beat it.“
Moham highlight reel series
it's weird bc FearX had the same mindset too but they decided Nasus + Ivern/Maokai were the higher priority bans than Rell for some reason. those picks seem way easier to deal with than Moham's Rell.
And bro would pick morgana
it's cuz rell's W drags towards the end and applies the knockup with the drag so basically he timed it such that he landed on the ground and used the 0.5s drag to time it on the TP
Do better. be better.
FOX’s refusal to ban Muhammad Ali’s Rell the entire series just baffles me
Moham: constantly finds BIG engages with rell, made game 3 which DK lost last longer too.

FOX: Nah, give Moham Rell, ez clap.
FOX was so bad in game 5 even canonically wrong Yasuo without 0/10 powerspike managed to win the game.
How many ults did Moham hit in this series HOLY
MOHAM IS HIM.
And how have you come to that conclusion? Actually I know exactly how, I remember you using win rates to judge player performances before. Let me guess because both players have 40% win rates on Rell they are bad according to you?

By that logic Viper is a mediocre Aphelios player right? Because he only has 50% wr on that champ

Aiming is one of the best Ezreal/Kaisa players in the LCK and he barely has over 50% wr on those champs

Don’t blindly use stats without context.
that's true of the Daeny coached teams too, everyone including coaching staff and players made it clear that the players decided to let Yuumi through
Lets give Moham Rell again. Whats the worse that could happen? Ryu needs to quit man icant with this draft...
I love watching those wombos, fun last game
Hasn't been super clean, but overall a really strong showing from DK. Unless the winner of KT/T1 giga stomps the series in a 3-0 fashion and ends sub 22 mins each game, there's no way GenG will pick DK. '

LCK playoffs are super interesting right now, couldn't have asked for a better set-up
B_N R_LL
GENG pick DK. I dare you. Pick DK and don’t ban Rell if you have balls.

GENG Game 1: „Ban Rell“
bin roll? - fox coaches
They literally changed their bans to nasus ivern after getting rekt by it, they're not stubborn they just can't ban every champ
ON just had really clean Rell series too. Just didn't LITERALLY play her all 4 games and obviously it wasn't AS GOOD of performance but still was really really good.
Is that the series with the crazy game 5 Kayn pick from Canyon ?
Or giving Faker Galio 5 games in a row
Moham embodied Rell the whole series.

He is one with the Rell.
Idk how a Corki and a Tristana is worth 2 bans than a Rell that's been making plays left and right for 3 games! 3! How braindead can they be???
tbh this was against a team that got initiated by a rell in vision more than 4 times 

lets see how he fares against actually good teams
I don’t think GENG is picking DK regardless..
He earned his LEC spot last year when he gave a win to G2
as a damwon fan i get sweaty seeing Kiin'sante get through
It‘s lunch time, sounds about right
5 games in a row means they beat it twice no?
